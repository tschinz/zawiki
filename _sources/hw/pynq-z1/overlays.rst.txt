Overlays
========

By default, an overlay (bitstream) called base is downloaded into the PL at boot time. The base overlay can be considered like a reference design for a board. New overlays can be installed or copied to the board and can be loaded into the PL as the system is running.

An overlay usually includes:

* A bitstream to configure the FPGA fabric
* A Vivado design Tcl file to determine the available IP
* Python API that exposes the IPs as attributes

Loading
=======

Instantiates
------------

.. code-block:: python

   from pynq import Overlay
   # instantiates the overlay and downloads it to the PL
   overlay = Overlay("base.bit")

Full Redownload
---------------

.. code-block:: python

   # for a full download of the bitstream
   overlay.download()

Partial Redownload
------------------

.. code-block:: python

   # set region
   overlay.set_partial_region('block_0')

   # download region
   overlay.download('rm_0_partial.bit')

Help
====
Once a overlas is instantiated the ``help()`` method can be used to discover its function.

.. code-block:: python

   from pynq.overlays.base import BaseOverlay
   base_overlay = BaseOverlay("base.bit")

   help(base_overlay)

   help(base_overlay.leds)
