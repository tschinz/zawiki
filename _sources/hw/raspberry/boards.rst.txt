Rpi 1B+
-------

The Model B+ is the final revision of the original Raspberry Pi. It replaced the Model B in July 2014 and was superseded by the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B

.. figure:: img/rpi_1b+.*
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

Compared to the Model B it has:

* More GPIO pins. The GPIO header has grown to 40 pins, while retaining the same pinout for the first 26 pins as the Model A and B.
* More USB ports. It comes with 4 USB 2.0 ports, compared to 2 on the Model B, and better hotplug and overcurrent behaviour.
* Micro SD. The old friction-fit SD card socket has been replaced with a much nicer push-push micro SD version.
* 100 Base Ethernet (same as the original Model B)
* Lower power consumption. By replacing linear regulators with switching ones we’ve reduced power consumption by between 0.5W and 1W.
* Better audio. The audio circuit incorporates a dedicated low-noise power supply.
* Neater form factor. We’ve aligned the USB connectors with the board edge, moved composite video onto the 3.5mm jack, and added four squarely-placed mounting holes.

Model A
=======

Rpi 3A+
-------

Compared to the Model A it has:

* More GPIO pins. The GPIO header has grown to 40 pins, while retaining the same pinout for the first 26 pins as the Model A and B.
* Micro SD. The old friction-fit SD card socket has been replaced with a much nicer push-push micro SD version.
* Lower power consumption. By replacing linear regulators with switching ones we’ve reduced power consumption by between 0.5W and 1W.
* Better audio. The audio circuit incorporates a dedicated low-noise power supply.
* Smaller neater form factor. We’ve aligned the USB connector with the board edge, moved composite video onto the 3.5mm jack, and added four squarely-placed mounting holes. Model A+ is approximately 2cm shorter than the Model A.

Compute Module
==============

Rpi CM3+
--------

The Compute Module 3+ (CM3+) is a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ in a flexible form factor, intended for industrial applications

.. figure:: img/rpi_cm3+.*
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

The CM3+ Compute Module contains the guts of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (the BCM2837 processor and 1GB RAM) as well as an optional eMMC Flash device of 8GB, 16GB or 32GB (which is the equivalent of the SD card in the Pi).

* Broadcom BCM2837B0, Cortex-A53 (ARMv8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.2GHz
* 1GB LPDDR2 SDRAM
* 8GB/16GB/32GB eMMC Flash memory, or a Lite variant without eMMC Flash memory

This is all integrated onto a small (67.6mm × 31mm) board that fits into a standard DDR2 SODIMM connector. The Flash memory is connected directly to the processor on the board, but the remaining processor interfaces are available to the user via the connector pins. You get the full flexibility of the BCM2837 SoC (which means that many more GPIOs and interfaces are available than with a standard Raspberry Pi), and designing the Module into a custom system should be relatively straightforward because we’ve put all the tricky bits onto the Module itself.

To help you get started designing a PCB to use the Module, we provide an open-source breakout board, which is supplied with both a 32GB and Lite version of the CM3+ in an affordable development kit.

Rpi CM3 IOBoard
