MVC
===

MVC is a the abbreviation for Model view Controller. It is a
Object-Oriented Design Pattern

   .. figure:: img/mvc.*

View
----

Is only in charge for the GUI. It is the slaves of the Controller. It
has limited connection to the Controller

-  action target - It can send an event to the Controller
-  It can delegate actions, the Controller would be a delegate of the
   View
-  It can get data from the controller

Controller
----------

The Controller defines **How** you Model is presented to the User (UI
Logic) Communicates to the View and the Model freely.

Model
-----

The Model is **What** your application is. It is here were all the
algorithms etc. are implemented. It has limited communication to the
Controller

-  Notification & KVO - It can "send out" informations and any body
   connected can "listen in". KVO = Key-Value Observer

Multiple MVC
============

For powerful apps multiple MVC's needs to be put together

   .. figure:: img/UINavigationController_mvc.*
      :align: center
      :width: 500px

-  iOS provides some Controllers whose View is "other MVC's". Examples:

   -  UITabBarController
   -  UISplitViewController
   -  UINavigationController
   -  UIScrollView

``UITabBarController``
----------------------

Tab bar can replace top part of the Screen with a different MVC bundle
(e.g. Health App)

``UISplitViewController``
-------------------------

Takes two MVC's and puts them side by side (iPad only)

-  Left MVC = Master
-  Right MVC = Detail

Landscape mode = Both MVC's side by side Portrait mode = Only Detail
view visible, Master view can be siped in from the left

(e.g. Mail)

``NavigationController``
------------------------

Can push and pop MVC's off of a stack. The Top MVC is shown an with it
the Titlebar and left and right button is placed. You can put a MVC into
the NavigationController Stack or push them off. The Sub MVC's are
created and destroyed at that point.

(e.g. Settings)

``UIScrollView``
----------------

-  Set content size
-  Add frames to the content area
-  Reposition the view (the window of the screen inside the screen)
-  Get area where you're looking at (contentOffset.x & y)

.. code:: swift

   scrollView.contentSize = CGSize(width: 3000, height:2000) // size of the scroll view
   // Add logo with
   logo.frame= CGRect(x: 2700, y:50, width: 120, height: 180)
   scrollView.addSubview(logo)
   // Add another image to the view at a different location
   aerial.frame = CGRect(x: 150, y: 200, width: 2500, height:1600)
   scrollView.addSubview(aerial)

   // Scroll in program
   func scrollRectToVisible(CGRect, animated: Bool)

Other things which can be done in ``scrollView``

-  Enable or disable scrolling
-  Lock scrolling direction
-  Style of scrolling indicator (``flashScrollIndicator``)
-  Whether your actual content is inset from the content area
   (``contentInset`` property)

Zooming
~~~~~~~

All ``UIView``'s have a property ``transform`` which is an affine
transformation (``translate``, ``scale``, ``rotate``). Zooming is
affecting the scroll view ``contentSize`` and ``contentOffset``.

.. code:: swift

   // They needed to be set for enabling zoom
   scrollView.minimumZoomScale = 0.5 // min half of its normal size
   scrollView.maximumZoomScale = 2.0 // max double its normal size

   // Will not work without delegate
   func viewForZoomingInScrollView(sender: UIScrollView) -> UIView

   // Zoom in program
   var zoomScale: CGFloat
   func setZoomScale(CGFloat, animated: Bool) // Zoom to a different scale (in middle of screen)
   func zoomToRect(CGRect, animated: Bool)    // Zoom to a rectangle (fill screen as much as possible)

.. _accessing-sub-mvc's:

Accessing Sub MVC's
-------------------

You can access sub-MVC's via the ``viewControllers`` property

.. code:: swift

   var viewControllers: [UIViewController] { get set } // possibly an optional

-  For a Tabbar they are ordered left to right, in the array.
-  For a Split View, [0] is the master and [1] is the detail.
-  For a NavigationController, [0] is the root and the rest are in order
   on the stack.

**Get ahold of the NC, SVC, TBC** Every ``UIViewController`` knows the
SplitView, TabBar or Navigation Controller it is currently in. These are
``UIViewController`` properties:

.. code:: swift

   var tabBarController: UITabBarController? { get }
   var splitViewController: UISplitViewController? { get }
   var navigationController: UINavigationController? { get }
   // for example, the get the detail of the split view controller your are in...
   if let detailVC: UIViewController = splitViewController?.viewControllers[1] { ... }

.. _wiring-up-mvc's:

Wiring up MVC's
---------------

In Story board or Code but Storyboard is more common. For Storyboard

-  Drag out a SplitViewController
-  Ctrl drag from SplitViewController to the Master MVC
-  Ctrl drag from SplitViewController to the Detail MVC
-  Split View can only work on a Regular size device (iPhone is a
   compact device). Therefore t can't display Master and Detail on the
   same screen. The master need to be Embed in a n Navigation Controller

   -  Select Master
   -  ``Editor->Embed In->NavigationController``

Segues
------

Seques are used that one MVC can cause appear another MVC. There are
different kind of Segues

-  Show Segue (will push NavigationCtonroller, else Modal)
-  Show Detail Segue (will show in Detail of a SplitView or will push in
   a NavigationController)
-  Modal Segue ( take over the entire screen while the MVC us up)
-  Popover Segue () make the MVC appear in a little popover window

Segue always creates new instances of MVC

Creating Segue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Ctrl drag from two View into each other
-  Click on the Circle in the middle of the segue
-  Choose an Identifier for the Segue from the Attribute Inspector
-  Perform Segue in code, with the method from UIViewController. (Not
   often mosten made in Storyboard)

.. code:: swift

   func performSegueWithIdentifier(identifier. String, sender: AnyObject?)

Prepare Segue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Identifier are used for preparing for a Segue. A Segue creates a new MVC
which is empty, it needs to be prepared with the correct content. A
Segue passes two informations:

-  The Identifier from the Storybaord
-  The Controller of the MVC you are segueing to (which was just created
   for you)
-  sender is the Object from the storyboard (e.g. UIButton) which caused
   the segue to happen.

.. code:: swift

   func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryBoardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {
       if let identifier = segue.identifier {
           switch identifier {
               case "Show Graph":
                   // beause it is anyObject it needs to be turned into the correct class
                   if let vc = segue.destinationViewController as? MyController {
                       vc.property1 = ...
                       vc.callMethodToSetUp(...)
                   }
               default: break
           }
       }
   }

!!! Important. While preparing an MVC its outlet are not set yet.

Prevent Segue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preventing segue from happening. You need to implement

.. code:: swift

   func shouldPerfromSegueWithIdentifier(identifier: String?, sender: AnyObject?) -> Bool

Popover
-------

A popover open en entire MVC. The rest of the screen is grayed out. The
Pointer of the Popover points to the button created the Popover.

-  Popover works with Segue as the other ViewControllers
-  Preparing for a popover

   -  All segues are managed via a ``UIPresentationController``

Preparing a Popover
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: swift

   func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryBoardSegue, sender: AnyObject) {
       if let identifier = segue.identifier {
           switch identifier {
               case: "Do something in a popover Segue":
                   if let vc = segue.destinationViewController as? MyController {
                       // get popover presentation controller
                       if let ppc = vc.popoverPresentationController {
                           ppc.permittedArrowDirections = UIPopoverArrowDirection.Any
                           ppc.delegate = self
                       }
                       // more prepration here
                   }
           }
       }
   }

Popover Presentation Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Popover Presentation Delegate (see code above) can manipulate and
adapt the popover **Adaptation**

.. code:: swift

   func adaptivePresentationStyleForPresentationContoller(UIPresentationController) -> UIModelPresentationStyle {
       return UIModalPresentationStyle.None // default .FullScreen
   }

**FullScreen**

.. code:: swift

   func presentationController(UIPresentationController, viewControllerForAdaptivePresentationStyle: UIModalPresentationStyle) -> UIViewController? {
       // return a UIViewController to use (e.g. Wrap Navigation Controller around your MVC)
   }

**Size** Popover should be the needed size of the containing MVC.

.. code:: swift

   var preferredContentSize: CGSize
