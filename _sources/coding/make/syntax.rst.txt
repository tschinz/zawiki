Make Commands
=============
The execution of make isn't hard. Below a list of possible make commands.

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: make_commands

   make                     # search "Makefile" file and executes it
   make makefilename        # search "makefilename" file and executes it
   make -C /.../other_path/ # search "make" file in given path
   make -d                  # gives debug informations
   make -file               # read file as makefile
   make -t                  # make updates the date of the targets

Generation Makefile
===================

Targets, Rules, Dependencies
----------------------------
A makefile generates a **Target**. This is done with help of **Rules**. Each target is dependend of other files, these are the **Dependencies**.

In the example the target is depending on file.c and file.h. It will be created with the file.c

.. code-block:: make
   :caption: make

   target: file.c file.h
       gcc file.c -o target

The target will be generated if ``file.cv or ``file.h`` are newer than the existing target.

Pattern
-------

With help of pattern can define dependencies on a group of files in one line.

for example all ``.o`` files depend on the appropriate ``.c`` files

.. code-block:: make
   :caption: make

   %.o: %.c
       gcc -Wall -g -c $<

Most used predefined variables

.. code-block:: make
   :caption: predefined variables

   $<     # Name of the first dependency
   $@     # Name of the target
   $+     # List of all dependencies
   $^     # List of all dependencies, doubles will be eliminated

variabels can be accessed by ``$``. In order to write a real ``$``, ``$$`` need to be typed.

Variables
---------

It is possible to work with variables to save names. Usually these vrariables are kept UPPERCASE. Here some of the most used variables

.. code-block:: make
   :caption: variables

   CC       # Compiler e.g. fcc
   CFLAGS   # Compiler options r.g. -Wall
   LDFLAGS  # Linker options
   OBJ      # Objectfiles *.o
   SRC      # Sourcefiles *.c
   HDR      # Headerfiles *.h

An access of a variable can be done by ``$()``. And it can be changes and used as ofter as necessary.

.. code-block:: make

   OBJ = file1.o file2.o file3.o # Variable declaration
       Rm -rf $(OBJ)             # Use of the variable OBJ

Phony Targets
-------------

Phony targets have no dependencies, that the difference to the normal targets. But unlike normal targets with no depencies, they need to be **executed all the time**.

.. code-block:: make

   .PHONY clean
   clean:
       rm -rf file1.o file2.o

Includes
--------

A Makefile can with the help of the inlcude command use the variable and makros of other Makefiles

.. code-block:: make

   INC_FILE = makefile2

   include dateiname
   include ${INC_FILE}

Recursiv
--------

If you work on a big project. Sourcefiles can be widely spread among different folders. Instead to put all dependencies in one Makefile, they can be splitted so different makefile in the different folder.

In the **Toplevel Makefile** the general rules are set, and the Makefiles of the subfolders are called.

.. code-block:: make

   # Pos of the different Sub Makefiles
   DIRS = Module1 Module2 Module3

   Make:
       for i in $(DIRS); do make -c $$i; done
       # do "make" for all Makefiles in the Subfolders

The make ``-c`` flag tells that it has first to change to the new directory

A file called **Toplevel Makefiles.rules** defines all variables needed in the subfolders.

.. code-block:: make
   :caption: Makefile.rules

   CFLAGS = -Wall -g
   %.o: %.c                 # all .o depend on .c
       gcc $(CFLAGS) -c $<  # generation .o files

**Makefile in the subfolders**
Depending in the defined Object files and the Rules in Makefile.rules, the executed code will be defined.

.. code-block:: make

   Include ../Makefile.rules
   OBJ = file1.o file2.o
   all: $(OBJ)

Make dep
--------

Make dep is practical tools, which allows to search automatically dependencies in the sourcefiles.

.. code-block:: make

   DEPENDFILE = depend                 # Var for filename

   dep: $(SRC)
       $(CC) -MM $(SRC) > $(DEPENDFILE)# put output > file depend

   -include $(DEPENDFILE)           # search for include commands


with the flag ``-MM`` make will search in the ``SRC`` files for include directives. the command ``-include $(DEPENDFILE)`` adds the found dependencies into the Makefile

Specialsigns
------------

.. code-block:: make

   #                         # is a comment
   first part of command \   # Command split
   second part of command \  # into multiple
   third part of command     # lines
