=============
dd and ddfldd
=============

Use for creating and copying iso files from and to a medium.

The ``dd`` command doesn't has a output during copy but ``dcfldd`` does. It gives an output all X blocks written. This means in the commands below you can also just replace ``dd`` with ``dcfldd``.


Install
=======

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: dcfldd install

   sudo apt-get install dcfldd

On Linux
========

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: dd usage

   # Create usb stick or sdcard => image
   fdisk -l                                  # get disk info
   unmount /dev/sdX                          # unmount disk
   dd if=/dev/sdX of=/location/for/image.iso bs=1M conv=noerror,sync # copy usb stick to image

   # Copy image => usb stick or sdcard
   fdisk -l                                  # get disk info
   unmount /dev/sdX                          # unmount disk
   dd if=/location/of/image.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M conv=noerror,sync # copy image to usb stick

`dd` has no output normally, if you want to watch the status of the copy then open a new Terminal and try one of the following commands

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: watch dd

   sudo kill -USR1 $(pgrep '^dd$')                            # dd will display status once
   sudo watch -n <interval in sec> kill -USR1 $(pgrep '^dd$') # dd will display status continously

On MacOs
========

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: dd usage

   # Create usb stick or sdcard => image
   diskutil list                               # get disk info
   diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX             # unmount disk
   dd if=/dev/diskX of=/location/for/image.iso bs=1m # copy usb stick to image

   # Copy image => usb stick or sdcard
   diskutil list                              # get disk info
   diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX            # unmount disk
   dd if=/location/of/image.iso of=/dev/diskX bs=1m conv=noerror,sync # copy image to usb stick
