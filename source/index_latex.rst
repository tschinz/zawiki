This Repo is a collection of markdown and ReStructuredText pages. Here you can find various informations about topics I've always forget. This pages let me help to remember less but know more.

Site purpose and structure
==========================

Getting started
---------------

Want to try it for yourself? Then jump to the :doc:`getting started <about/getting_started>` page and have fun, but first you need to learn :doc:`ReStructured Text <writing/rst/cheatsheet>` !!!

You can view the content as a:

* :zawiki_page:`Webpage <>`
* `PDF <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tschinz/zawiki/blob/pdf/zawiki.pdf>`_
* :zawiki_repo:`Repo <>`


Known Issues / TODOs
--------------------

* Github CI not working for PDF creation
* Missing pages from original Zawiki
* missing links to config repo
