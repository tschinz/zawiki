This webpage is a collection of Markdown and ReStructuredText pages. Here you can find various informations about topics I always forget. These pages help me to remember less, but to know more.

Getting started
===============

Want to try it for yourself? Then jump to the :doc:`getting started <about/getting_started>` page and have fun, but first you need to learn :doc:`ReStructured Text <multimedia/writing/rst/cheatsheet>` !!!

You can view the content as a:

* :zawiki_page:`Webpage <>`
* `PDF <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tschinz/zawiki/blob/pdf/zawiki.pdf>`_
* :zawiki_repo:`Repo <>`

Known Issues
============

See also the `github issues <https://github.com/tschinz/zawiki/issues>`_ page
