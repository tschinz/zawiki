Site purpose and structure
==========================

Getting started
---------------

Want to try it for yourself? Then jump to the :doc:`getting started <about/getting_started>` page and have fun, but first you need to learn :doc:`ReStructured Text <writing/rst/cheatsheet>` !!!

You can view the content as a:

* :zawiki_page:`Webpage <>`
* `PDF <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tschinz/zawiki/blob/master/pdf/zawiki.pdf>`_
* :zawiki_repo:`Repo <>`

Known Issues / TODOs
--------------------

* Github CI not working for PDF creation
* Missing pages from original Zawiki
* missing links to config repo
