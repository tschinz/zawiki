pipenv
======

Pipenv is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world.

It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important Pipfile.lock, which is used to produce deterministic builds.

Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pipenv

.. note::

   Generally, keep both ``Pipfile`` and ``Pipfile.lock`` in version control.

``Pipfile``
===========

``Pipfile`` contain information for the dependencies of the project, and supersedes the ``requirements.txt`` file used in most Python projects.


Import from existing file
--------------------------------

The import will search first for a ``Pipfile`` and ``Pipfile.lock`` file. If found a virtual environemnt with that packages will be created. If there files are not found ``pipenv`` will search for a ``requirements.txt`` and create a new ``Pipfile`` with its content. Afterwards a virtual environment will be created from it.

.. code-block:: bash

   pipenv install


``Pipfile.lock``
================

This file lock all dependencies of the current installed packages

.. code-block:: bash

   pipenv lock

Packages
========

Install
-------
``*`` meant the latest version on that level

.. code-block:: python

   # Install from requirements.txt
   pipenv install

   # Install one package
   pipenv install <packagename>
   pipenv install <packagename>=='<version>'
   pipenv install Flask=='0.11.*'

   # Install dev packages
   pipenv install --dev <packagename>

Uninstall
---------

.. code-block:: python

   # uninstall one package
   pipenv uninstall <packagename>

   # uninstall all packages
   pipenv uninstall --all

   # uninstall all dev packages
   pipenv uninstall --all-dev

Update
------

Update all installed packages to the latest pip version

.. code-block:: bash

   pipenv update

Run
===

pipenv shell
------------

Each virtualenvironemnt has its own shell. In order to access it you have to launch it.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Goto project folder with Pipfile
   cd myproject

   # Launch virtual environment
   pipenv shell

   # Exit virtual environment
   exit

Run command in pipenv
---------------------

If you don't want to use the virtual environment shell you can also just launch one command with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pipenv run <commandname>
   pipenv run python app.py

Virtual environment
===================

Create new pipenv
-----------------

In order to create a new virtual environment define the python version.

.. code-block:: bash

   pipenv --python 3.6

Remove pipenv
-------------

If you want to remove a virtual envrironment launch

.. code-block:: bash

   pipenv --rm

Dependency Graph
================

.. code-block:: bash

   pipenv graph


Workflow
========

.. code-block:: bash

   # Goto git repo
   cd myproject

   # Install environment if there is a Pipfile
   # Also imports from requirements.txt if there is one
   pipenv install

   # Add new package to the project
   pipenv install <package>

   # Activate Pipenv shell
   pipenv shell
   python --version

   # Lock all dependencies in file Pipenv.lock
   pipenv lock

   # Run environment for project
   pipenv run <command>
