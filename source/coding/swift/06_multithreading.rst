Queue
=====

Multithreading is mostly about "queues" in iOS. Function (usually
closures) are lined up in a queue. The those functions are pulled off
the queue and executed on an associated thread.

.. _main-queue-(serial-queue):

Main queue (serial queue)
-------------------------

All UI activity **MUST** occur **only** on this queue. Also all NON-UI
activity that is all time consuming must **NOT** occur on that queue. We
want the UI to be responsive! Functions are pulled off and worked on in
the main queue only when it's quiet. All normal code will be happen in
the main queue.

.. code:: swift

   let mainQ: dispatch_queue_t = dispatch_get_main_queue()
   let mainQ: NSOperationQueue = NSOperationQueue.mainQueue() // for Object oriented API

   dispatch_async(not the mainQueue){
     // do something that might blok or tkaes a while
     dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) {
       // call UI Functions with the result of the above
     }
   }

Other queues
------------

iOS are creating those queue as needed.

Execute a function on another queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: swift

   let queue dispatch_queue_t = <get the queue you want....>
   dispatch_async(queue) {/* fo what you want to do here */}

Quality of Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most non-main-queue work will happen on a concurrent queue with a
certain quality of service.

.. code:: swift

   QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE // quick and high priority
   QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED   // high priority, might take time
   QOS_CLASS_UTILITY          // long running
   QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND       // user not concerned with this (prefetching etc.)
   let qos = INT(<one of the above>.value) // historical reasons
   let queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(qos, 0)

These queues can be used for work that won't block the main queue.

Create serial queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need serialization. E.g. downloading a bunch of things from a
certain website but you don't want to deluge that website, so you queue
the request up serially *OR* maybe the things you are doing depend on
each other in a serial fashion.

.. code:: swift

   let serialQ = dispatch_queue_create("name", DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL)

Do something in the future
==========================

You almost always ``dispatch_after`` into the main queue. All other
queues are anyway concurrent and can't guarantee time delay's.

.. code:: swift

   let delayInSeconds = 25.0
   let delay = Int64(delayInSeconds*Double(NSEC_PER_MSEC))
   let dispatchTime = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, delay) // adds delay to now
   dispatch_after(dispatchTime, dispatch_get_main_queue()) {
     // do something on the main queue 25 seconds from now
   }

Other Things
============

There's a lot more Multithreading stuff.

-  locking
-  protect critical sections
-  readers and writers
-  synchronous dispatch
-  etc....

Multithreading iOS API
======================

Many API are multithreaded and wont work on the main queue. Theirs works
need to be dispached elsewhere.

.. code:: swift

   let session = NSURLSESSION(NSURLSessionConfiguration.defaultSessionConfiguration())
   if let url = NSURL("http://url") {
       let request = NSURLRequest(URL:url)
       // not working
       let task = session.downloadTaskWithRequest(request) { (localURL, response, error) in
           // Here you can'r do UI Stuff with the result of the download!!
       }
       // working
       let task = session.downloadTaskWithRequest(request) { (localURL, response, error) in
           dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) {
               // Here you can do UI related stuff
           }
       }
   task.reasume()
   }

In the above example the UI code has been dispatched back to the main
queue. But understand that the code might run **MINUTES** after the
request is fired off. The user might have long ago given up on whatever
was being fetched.
