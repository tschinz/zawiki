=====
Views
=====

Views is a ``UIView`` subclass and it represents a rectangular Area on
the screen.

-  a View can have on superview
-  a View can have many subviews

``UIWindow`` is the very top of the view hierarchy (it even includes the
status bar). But normally you never interact with it.

**Top View** is a property of the Program called:

.. code:: swift

   var view: UIView

Initializing UIView
===================

.. code:: swift

   init(frame: CGRect)  // init of UIView created in code
   init(coder: NSCoder) // init of UIView comes out of storyboard

If you need an initializer set them **both**

.. code:: swift

   func setup() {...}

   override init(frame:CGRect) {            // a designated init
       super.init(frame: frame)
       setup()
   }

   required init(coder aDecoder: NsCoder) { // a required init
       super.init(coder: aDecoder)
       setup()
   }

.. _view's-coordinate-system:

View's Coordinate System
========================

-  Origin = upper left
-  Units are points (not pixels)
-  One point can have multiple pixels

.. code:: swift

   var contentSacleFactor: CGFloat // get number of pixels per point

-  Boundaries is where drawings happen

.. code:: swift

   var bounds: CGRect // a vies internal drawing space's origin and size

-  The UIView location

.. code:: swift

   var center: CGPoint // center of a UIView in its superview's coordinate system
   var frame : CGRect  // the rect containing a UIview in its superview's coordinate system

-  Bounds vs Frame |Coordinate|

.. code::

   View B's bounds = ( (0  ,0) , (250,200) )
   View B's frame  = ( (140,65), (320,320) )
   View B's center = ( 300,225 )
   View B's middle = (bounds.midX, bounds.midY) = (100,125)

Creating a View
===============

**In Stroyboard**

-  Drag UIView into storyboard
-  User ``Identity Inspector`` to changes it's class to your sublcass

**In Code** Assuming this code is in the UIViewController

.. code:: swift

   let labelRect = CGRect(x: 20, y:20 , width: 100, height:50)
   let label = UILabel(frame: labelRect) // UILabel is a sublcass of UIView
   label.text = "Hello"
   view.addSubview(label)

View transparency
=================

Layers are defined in th order they are in the subviews list

-  First in the list are the lower layers
-  Later in the list are on Top
-  Transparency is not cheap

Hide a view
===========

A hidden view don't receive touch inputs or events and can draw nothing
on screen

.. code:: swift

   var hidden: Bool

Custom View
===========

Used when

-  Draw some custom drawing on screen
-  If touch events need to be handeled differently

To create just create a UIView subclass and override drawRect.

.. code:: swift

   override func drawRect(regionThatNeedsToBeDrawn: CGRect)

-  **Never** call drawRect, if a View needs to be redraw use:

.. code:: swift

   setNeedsDisplay()
   setNeedsDisplayinRect(regionThatNeedsToBeDrawn: CGRect)

Drawing
=======

Drawing Text
------------

Usually ``UILabel`` is used to put text on screen

To draw in ``drawRect`` use ``NSAttributedString`` or
``NSMutableAttributedString``

.. code:: swift

   // Immutable
   let text = NSAttributedString("Hello")
   text.drawAtPoint(aCGPoint)
   let textSize: CGSize = text.size // space used for the string
   // Mutable
   let mutableText = NSMutableAttributedString("some String")

   // Set Attributes
   func setAttributes(attributes: Dictionary, range: NSRange)
   func addAttributes(attributes: Dictionary, range: NSRange)

   NSForegroundColorAttributeName : UIColor
   NSStrokeWidthAttributeName: CGFloat
   NSFontAttributeNAme : UIFont

Drawing Images
--------------

**``UIImage`` object**

.. code:: swift

   let image: UIImage? = UIImage(named: "foo")

-  Images are added in the project in ``Images.xcassets`` file
-  Images can have different resolutions for different devices (all
   managed by Images.xcassets)

**From the file system**

.. code:: swift

   let image: UIImage? = UIImage(contentOfFile: aString)
   let image: UIImage? = UIImage(data: anNSData) // raw .jpg, .png, .tiff, ...

**Drawing image on screen**

.. code:: swift

   image.drawAtPoint(aCGPoint)         // upper left of the image put at aCGPoint
   image.drawInRect(aCGPoint)          // scales image to fit aCGRect
   image.drawAsPAtternInRect(aCGPoint) // tiles the image into aCGRect

Bound change ``UIViewContentMode``
----------------------------------

Bound can change if the device is rotated etc.

-  By default there is no redraw
-  Content and images are getting streched
-  Can be changed in the ``UIView`` property

.. code:: swift

   var contentMode: UIViewContentMode
   // Don't scale to view but place it somewhere else
   .Left/.Right/.Top/.Bottom/.TopRight/.BottomRight/.BottomLeft/.Center
   // Scale view
   .ScaleToFit/.ScaleAspectFill/.ScaleAspectFit // scale to fill is the default
   // Redraw by calling drawRect again
   .Redraw // This is the one you should use

``UIBezierPath``
----------------

.. code:: swift

   // Create
   let path = UIBezierPath()
   // Move, add line or arcs to the path
   path.moveToPoint(CGPoint(80,50)) // assume screen is 160x250
   path.addLineToPoint(CGPoint(140,150))
   path.addLineToPoint(CGPoint(10,150))
   // Close path to start point
   path.closePath()
   // Set attributes and stroke / fill
   UIColor.greenColor().setFill() // method of UIColor
   UIColor.redColor().setStroke() // method of UIColor
   path.linewidth = 3.0           // property in UIBezierPath
   path.fill()
   path.stroke()

**Other shapes**

.. code:: swift

   let roundRect = UIBezierPath(roundedRect: aCGRect, cornerRadius: aCGFloat)
   let oval = UIBezierPath(ovelInRect: aCGRect)
   // ... and others

**Clipping**

.. code:: swift

   addClip()

**HitDetection** For HitDetection a path must be closed

.. code:: swift

   func containsPoint(CGPoint) -> Bool // tells whether a point is inside a path

``UIColor``
===========

.. code:: swift

   // Colors can also b RGB, HSB or even a pattern (using UIImage)
   let green = UIColor.greenColor()
   // Background Color
   var backgroundColor : UIView
   // Colors can have alpha (transparency)
   let transparentYellow = UIColor.yellowColor().colorwithAlphaComponent(0.5)
   // 0.0 = fully transparent 1.0 = fully opaque
   // Transparency must be enabled in the UIView
   var opaque = false
   // Entire UIView transparent
   var alpha: CGFloat

``UIFont``
==========

.. code:: swift

   class func preferredFontForTextStyle(UIFontTextStyle) -> UIFont

   UIFontTextStyle.Headline
   UIFontTextStyle.Body
   UIFontTextStyle.Footnote

**System Font**

Not used for user content

.. code:: swift

   class func systemFontOfSize(pointSize: CGFloat) -> UIFont
   class func boldsystemFontOfSize(pointSize: CGFloat) -> UIFont

Coordinate System
=================

Data Structures
---------------

.. code:: swift

   // CGFloat never user double or float for coordinated
   let cfg = CGFloat(aDouble)

   // CFPoint = two CFFloats in x and y
   var point = CGPointer(x: 37.0, y: 55.2)
   point.y -= 30
   point.x += 20.0

   // CGSize = struct with two CGFloats in width and height
   var size = CGSize(width: 100.0, height: 50.0)
   size.width  += 42.5
   size.height += 75

   // CGRect = CGPoint and CGSize
   struct CGRect {
       var origin: CGPoint
       var size  : CGSize
   }
   let rect = CGRect(origin: aCGPoint, size: aCGSize)
   // Other CGRect properties and methods
   var minx: CGFloat          // left edge
   var midY: CGFloat          // midpoint vertically
   intersects(CGRect) -> Bool // does CGRect intersect with otehr one?
   intersect(CGRect)          // clip the CGRect to the intersection wit hthe other one
   contains(CGPoint) -> Bool  // does CGRect contain the given CGPoint?
   //.. and many more

Connection to storyboard
========================

The ``@``\ keywords are making connection to the storyboard

.. code:: swift

   import UIKit

   @IBDesignable // live view in storyBoard
   class ViewController: UIView {
       @IBInspectable // Makes the var changable in storyboard (Attribute Inspector)
       var test: Int = 10
   }

Autolayout
==========

The main rules for autolayout

-  Using the dash blue lines
-  Ctrl dragging between View to make relationships
-  Use Pin and Arrange popovers in the lower right corner
-  Reset to Suggested Constraints
-  Document outline, where you can see all defined constraints
-  Size Inspector for read and edit details of the constraint
-  Do as much as possible in storyboard

Autorotation
------------

In some cases autorotation changes the view drastically and things needs
be rearranged (e.g. Calculator Buttons).

Size Classes
------------

There two size classes in iOS:

-  Compact
-  Regular
-  Any

See all devices and theirs size classes in either portrait or landscape.
|Size Classes|

MVC can also get their size class.

.. code:: swift

   let mySizeClasse: UIUSerInterfaceSizeClass = self.traitCollection.horizontalSieClass
   // will return either .Compact or .Regular or .Unspecified

Gestures
========

-  A ``UIView`` can get notified when a gestures happens

   -  Raw gestures (touch down, moved, up etc.)
   -  We can react to predefined "gestures"

-  Gestures are recognized by instance of ``UIGestureRecognizer``

   -  Concrete subclasses are used never the base class

   1. (recognize) Adding a gesture recognizer to a ``UIView`` (ask a
      ``UIVew`` to recognize a gesture)
   2. (handle) Providing a method to "handle" that gesture (not
      necessarily by the ``UIView``)

-  "Recognize" is done by the Controller
-  "Handling" is provided either by the ``UIView`` or a ``Controller``

.. _add-a-gesture-recognizer-(to-a-view):

Add a Gesture recognizer (to a View)
------------------------------------

.. code:: swift

   // Normal outlet to the UIView we want to recognize the gesture
   // The Target gets notified when the gesture is recognized (in this case the Controller itself)
   // The action is the method invoked on recognition (the : means it has an argument)
   @IBoutlet ewak var pannableView: UIView {
       didSet {
           let recognizer = UIPanGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: "pan:")
           pannableView.addGestureRecognizer(recognizer)
       }
   }

Handling a Gesture
------------------

-  A handler for a gesture needs gesture-specific information
-  For Example, ``UIPanGestureRecognizer`` provides 3 methods

.. code:: swift

   func translationInView(view: UIView) -> CGPoint // cumulative since start of recognize
   func velocityInView(view: UIView) -> CGPoint    // how fast the finger is moving (points/s)
   func setTranslation(translation: CGPoint, inView: UIView) // allows to reset translation, you end up getting incremental translation

-  The abstract superclass also provides state information

.. code:: swift

   var state: UIGestureRecognizerState { get }
   // Possible states
   .Possible   // start at possible gesture
   .Recognized // gesture recognized
   .Changed    // gesture changed
   .Ended      // gesture ended

**e.g. Pan Handler**

.. code:: swift

   func pan(gesture: UIPanGestureRecognizer) {
       switch gesture.state {
           case .Changed: falltrough // execute code of the next case
           case .Ended:
               let translation = gesture.translationInView(pannableview)
               // update anything that depends on the pan gesture using translation.x and .y
               gesture.setTranslation(CGPointZero, InView: pannableView) // optional
           default: break
       }
   }

Possible Gestures
-----------------

-  ``UIPinchGestureRecognizer``

.. code:: swift

   var scale: CGFloat            // not read-only (can reset)
   var velocity: CGFloat { get } // scale factor per second

-  ``UIRotationGestureRecognizer``

.. code:: swift

   var rotation: CGFloat         // not read-only (can reset); in radians
   var velocity: CGFloat { get } // radians per second

-  ``UISwipeGestureRecognizer`` Set up the direction and nbr of fingers,
   then look for ``.Recognized``

.. code:: swift

   var direction: UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirection // which swipes you want
   var numberOfTouchesRequired: Int                 // finger count

-  ``UITapGestureRecognizer`` Set up the number of taps and fingers you
   want, then look for ``.Ended``

.. code:: swift

   var numberOfTapsRequired: Int    // single tap, double tap, etc.
   var numberOfTouchesRequired: Int // finger count

View Controller
---------------

**Live Cycle**

-  Creation: MVC is most often instantiated out of the storyboard

-  Preparing

-  Outlet setting

-  ``viewDidLoad()`` is called:

   -  Good place for setup code

   .. code:: swift

      override func viewDidLoad() {
          super.viewDidLoad() // always have super the chance in lifecycle methods
          // do some MVC setup
          // update your UI for your Model
          // geometry is not set, don't do geometry related things things
      }

-  Geometry will be set

-  Appearing ``viewWillAppear`` & ``viewDidAppear`` &
   ``viewWillDisappear`` & ``viewDidDisappear``

   .. code:: swift

      func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) { // animated is wether your are appearing over time
          super.viewWillAppear(animated)
          // geometry is set
          // some expensive stuff
      }

      func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {
          super.viewDidAppear(animated) // all super
          // ...
      }

      override func viewWillDisappear(animated: Bool) {
          super.viewWillDisappear(animated) // call super method
          // do some cleanup
          // not do anything time-consuming or the app will be slow
      }

      func viewDidDisappear(animated: Bool) {
          super.viewDidDisappear(animated)
      }

-  Geometry changes

   -  If the layout can change these two functions are called. These
      functions can be called alot.

   .. code:: swift

      func viewWillLayoutSubviews()
      // Autolayout is happening in between
      func viewDidLayoutSubviews()

   -  Autolayout is the same as bound change (see above)

   .. code:: swift

      func viewWillTransitionToSize(size: CGSize, withTransitionCoordinator: UIViewControllerTransistionCoordinator)

-  Low Memory Situation

   .. code:: swift

      func didReceiveMemoryWarning() { // happends rarely
          // Anything big in use should be freed by setting the pointers to it to nil
      }

-  ``awakeFromNib``

   -  all object that come from out of the storyboard getting this
      method before it's outlets are set.
