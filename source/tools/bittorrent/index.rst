Introduction
============

BitTorrent (abbreviated to BT) is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) which is used to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet.
The downlaod can be of any size and can be started and restarted as wanted. A checksum verifies the data after the finished download.

Per default all clients who downloads a file become automatic Seeders (means uploaders). Be aware of its implications.

Bittorrent clients
==================

There are many Bittorrent clients out there. The most common in my case are

* `uTorrent <https://www.utorrent.com/>`_ |linux| |mac| |win|
* `qBittorrent <https://www.qbittorrent.org/>`_ |linux| |mac| |win|

I prefer uTorrent for downlaods only and qBittorrent for creating Bittorrent because it has an integrated Bittorrent Tracker.
