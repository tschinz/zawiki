Site purpose and structure
==========================

Getting started
---------------

Want to try it for yourself? Then jump to the :doc:`getting started <about/getting_started>` page and have fun, but first you need to learn :doc:`ReStructured Text <writing/rst/cheatsheet>` !!!

You can view the content as a:

* `Webpage <http://tschinz.github.io/zawiki>`_
* `PDF <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tschinz/zawiki/blob/pdf/zawiki.pdf>`_
* `Repo <https://github.com/tschinz/zawiki>`_


Known Issues / TODOs
