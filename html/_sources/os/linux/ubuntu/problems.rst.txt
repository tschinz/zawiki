How to fix problems I've encountered.

Perl locale warning
-------------------

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: perl locale warning

   perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
   perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
           LANGUAGE = "",
           LC_ALL = (unset),
           LC_TIME = "de_CH.UTF-8",
           LC_MONETARY = "de_CH.UTF-8",
           LC_COLLATE = "de_CH.UTF-8",
           LC_ADDRESS = "en_US.UTF-8",
           LC_TELEPHONE = "en_US.UTF-8",
           LC_NAME = "en_US.UTF-8",
           LC_MEASUREMENT = "de_CH.UTF-8",
           LC_IDENTIFICATION = "en_US.UTF-8",
           LC_NUMERIC = "de_CH.UTF-8",
           LC_PAPER = "en_US.UTF-8",
           LANG = "C"
       are supported and installed on your system.
   perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Solution

   sudo locale-gen de_CH.UTF-8
