Crontab
=======

Cron allows tasks to be automatically run in the background at regular intervals by the cron daemon. These tasks are often termed as cron jobs.  Crontab (CRON TABle) is a file which contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and at specified times.

Crontab is used to regularly execute some task e.g. shell scripts

Restrictions
============
You can execute crontab if your name appears in the file: ``/usr/lib/cron/cron.allow``.
If that file does not exist, you can use crontab if your name does not appear in the file: ``/usr/lib/cron/cron.deny``.
If only cron.deny exists and is empty, all users can use crontab. If neither file exists, only the root user can use crontab. The allow/deny files consist of one user name per line.

Crontab Viewer
==============
To define the editor to use write the following in your ``~/.bashrc``

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: ~/.bashrc

   export VISUAL=vim
   export EDITOR=vim

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: crontab

   crontab -l    # List crontab's for current user
   crontab -r    # Del  crontab's for current user
   crontab -e    # Edit crontab's for current user

Crontab file
============

A crontab file has five fields for specifying day, date and time followed by the command to be run at that interval.

.. code-block::

   *   *   *   *   *   *      command to be executed
   +   +   +   +   +   +
   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   +--- Absolute path to script
   |   |   |   |   +------- day of week  (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)
   |   |   |   +----------- month        (1 - 12)
   |   |   +--------------- day of month (1 - 31)
   |   +------------------- hour         (0 - 23)
   +----------------------- min          (0 - 59)

``*`` in the value field above means all legal values as in braces for that column.
The value column can have a ``*`` or a list of elements separated by commas. An element is either a number in the ranges shown above or two numbers in the range separated by a hyphen (meaning an inclusive range).
Notes

* Repeat pattern like ``/2`` for every 2 minutes or ``/10`` for every 10 minutes is not supported by all operating systems. If you try to use it and crontab complains it is probably not supported.
* The specification of days can be made in two fields: month day and weekday. If both are specified in an entry, they are cumulative meaning both of the entries will get executed .


Entry Examples
==============

A line in crontab file like below removes the tmp files from ``/home/someuser/tmp`` each day at 6:30 PM.

.. code-block::

   30     18     *     *     *         rm /home/someuser/tmp/*

.. code-block::

   :caption: crontab entries

   0 * * * * /home/user/backupServerA.sh  # At Noon each day
   0 0 * * * /home/user/backupServerB.sh  # At Midnight each day
   0 1 * * * /home/user/backupServerC.sh  # At 1 o'clock each day
   0 * * * 1 /home/user/backupServerD.sh  # At Noon each Monday
   @reboot /home/user/Documents/x11vnc_start.bash
   @reboot nohup airsonos &
   @weekly /home/user/script.bash > /home/user/scriptoutput.log

Changing the parameter values as below will cause this command to run at different time schedule below:

Environment
===========

Cron invokes the command from the user’s ``HOME`` directory with the shell ``/usr/bin/sh``. Cron supplies a default environment for every shell, defining:
<code bash>

.. code-block:: bash

   HOME=user’s-home-directory
   LOGNAME=user’s-login-id
   PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:.
   SHELL=/usr/bin/sh

Disable Email
=============

By default cron jobs sends a email to the user account executing the cronjob. If this is not needed put the following command At the end of the cron job line.

.. code-block:: bash

   >/dev/null 2>&1

Generate log file
=================

To collect the cron execution execution log in a file :

.. code-block::

   30 18 * * * rm /home/someuser/tmp/* > /home/someuser/cronlogs/clean_tmp_dir.log

Execute script as sudo
======================

In order to let a crontab script run as sudo you need to give the script sudo rights without asking for a password.
This can be achieved by adding the script to the root crontab instead of the user crontab. the following command will let you edit the root crontab.

.. code-block::

   sudo crontab -e

The Crontab entry will be a simple script call

.. code-block::

   * * * * * /location/to/script.bash
